#### Welcome!

I am a Research Associate in the [Automated Verification](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/verification/) group at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), working with Prof. [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/). Previously, I was a doctoral student (yet to defend) at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), advised by Prof. [Daniel Neider](https://researchers.rc-trust.ai/neider/). Broadly, I am interested in the analysis and verification of systems used in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Earlier, I was a student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) (CMI) from where I obtained both my bachelor's 
and master's degree.
