#### Welcome!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Trustworthy Autonomous Cyber Physical Systems](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~acps/home/) group, working with Prof. [Xiaowei Huang](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/xiaowei-huang). Earlier, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Automated Verification](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/verification/) group at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), working with Prof. [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/). I did my doctoral research at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), advised by Prof. [Daniel Neider](https://researchers.rc-trust.ai/neider/). Broadly, I am interested in the formal specification and verification of systems used in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Earlier, I was a student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) (CMI) from where I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degree.
