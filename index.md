#### Welcome!

I am a doctoral student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), Kaiserslautern advised 
by [Dr. Daniel Neider](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~neider/). Broadly, I am interested in analysing and formal verification of 
systems used in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Earlier, I was a student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) (CMI) from where I obtained both my bachelor's 
and master's degree.
