My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of Formal Methods (FM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, I am focused on ensuring the safety and reliability of systems commonly used in AI applications. To this end, I have been exploring rigorous techniques to explain and verify the behavior of AI systems.

I have worked on designing algorithms for detecting temporal patterns in system behavior using human-interpretable [temporal logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic). Additionally, I have worked on the verification of neural networks by abstracting their high-level behavior using surrogate models such as [finite automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).
