Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of formal verification, 
and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am interested in providing explanations and
verifying black-box systems commonly used in Artificial Intelligence. To this end, we
use formal models such as Temporal Logic and Automaton models for providing explanations.
