Broadly, my research interests lie in the intersection of Formal Verification, Artificial Intelligence 
and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in providing human-interpretable descriptions
of complex systems in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, I am also interested in exploring how 
simple systems descriptions (usually using [automaton models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) 
or [logical specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic)) can aid the systematic 
verification of such systems.
