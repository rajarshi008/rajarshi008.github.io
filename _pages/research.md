Broadly, my research interests lie in the intersection of Formal Verification, Artificial Intelligence 
and Machine Learning. More specifically, I am interested in providing human-interpretable descriptions
of complex systems in Artificial Intelligence, and consequently, aiding the systematic verification of such 
systems.
